# Rateit
![Image](../../pages/index/img/rateit.png)

* _Do you use Reddit but want the capability to rate things rather than just upvoting or downvoting?_
<br/><br/>
* _Do you want to hear feedbacks of yourself or something you're interested in from people you like?_
<br/><br/>
_**Well...**_
<br/><br/>
_**WE MIGHT JUST HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU!**_

## How It Works
* First thing first, we provide **TWO** sites for two groups of people:
   * The **Requestors'** site is for people who want feedback, for _**LITERALLY ANYTHING**_
   * The **Evaluators'** site is for people who want to search for evaluations for _**LITERALLY ANYTHING**_<br>
    AS WELL AS evaluate it on their own!

## Links - Take a Look while we demonstrate how to use it!

## How to use it? (For Requestors)
**Just so that you know, it's REALLY simple**
<br/>
* Give it a title (could be yourself, could be anything you want others to evaluate)!
* Give it a short description, or not
* Upload an image or images if you want
* If you don't want others to go too deep, disable commenting and rating!
* Make it private if you wish
* Add whatever tags you feel like you want others to 'check'
* You want 100 stars? We've Got You Covered! (What a fag...)
* Don't forget to Hit that 'Submit' HARD once you're done

## How to use it? (For Requestors)
**Just so that you know, it's EVEN simpler**
<br/>
* We BELIEVE that all you need is an **pandora input box**!
* Enter the EXACT thing you are looking for or wanting to evaluate for
    * Everything you've ever asked for will pop up
    * See how other people like it
    * Give your own shot!
